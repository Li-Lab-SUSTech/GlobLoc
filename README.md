# GlobLoc
 GlobLoc is a graphics processing unit (GPU) based global fitting algorithm with flexible PSF modeling and parameter sharing, to extract maximum information from multi-channel single molecule data. Global fitting can substantially improve the 3D localization precision for biplane and 4Pi SMLM and color assignment for ratiometric multicolor imaging. The fitting speeds achieve ~35,000 fits/s on a standard GPU (NVIDIA RTX3090) for regions of interest (ROI) with a size of 13Ã—13 pixels.

# Requirements
Matlab R2019a or newer  
  - Curve Fitting Toolbox
  - Optimization Toolbox

The GPU fitter requires:
  
  - Microsoft Windows 7 or newer, 64-bit
  - CUDA capable graphics card, minimum Compute Capability 6.1
  - CUDA 10.1 compatible graphics driver (for GeForce products 471.41 or later)

The CPU version runs on macOS and Microsoft Windows 7 or newer, 64-bit

 # How to run
 Example code is avalible in file **Example_GlobalFit_biplane.m**. The required test data for the demo code can be found in the folder by following [this link](https://oc.embl.de/index.php/s/bs1ADBsc4t6aiVV). GlobLoc has been fully integrated in fit3Dcspline plugin of [SMAP](https://github.com/jries/SMAP/tree/develop).A full instruction guide can be found in the [supplementary material](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.22.461230v1.supplementary-material)  (**Tutorial of globFit.pdf**) of the paper.
