# GlobLoc
 GlobLoc is a graphics processing unit (GPU) based global fitting algorithm with flexible PSF modeling and parameter sharing, to extract maximum information from multi-channel single molecule data. Global fitting can substantially improve the 3D localization precision for biplane and 4Pi SMLM and color assignment for ratiometric multicolor imaging. The fitting speeds achieve ~35,000 fits/s On a standard GPU (NVIDIA RTX3090) for regions of interest (ROI) with a size of 13Ã—13 pixels.
